# Project Docs
Sample of some of the work I do in my spare time. Almost all of these were a combination
of wanting to try something new (language feature, platform, tooling, third party library) together
with building a tool that I had a use for. They were all built with my own requirements in mind,
not aimed at being marketted for anyone else.

None of them represent production level quality code. I was intended to be the only author, and most
are incomplete having served their purpose (tooling or learning).
