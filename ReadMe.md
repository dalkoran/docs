# Project Docs
Sample of some of the work I do in my spare time. Almost all of these were a combination
of wanting to try something new (language feature, platform, tooling, third party library) together
with building a tool that I had a use for. They were all built with my own requirements in mind,
not aimed at being marketted for anyone else.

Some of them are very rough, certainly cosmetically and parts of the code wouldn't stand up
well to a good review. But they do give some indication of the types of projects I like to work
on and can stitch together with limited time.
