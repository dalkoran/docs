# Privacy Policy

**FanLore** does not track or transmit any personal information.

Application logs may be generated (for debugging purposes), but these are stored locally in your APPDATA folder and can only be accessed by you. The information contained in these logs may include the names of the character and map files you load into the app.

The characters and maps (and any other content) that you generate using FanLore are only ever stored in the location you specify in the Settings, by default that will be in your Documents folder.
