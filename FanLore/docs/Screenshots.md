The Character Generation screen allows you to walk through creating a character from scratch. You can generate a fully randomized character in seconds, or you can painstakingly tweak character point assignments to create to your specific desires.

You can select or randomly determine a birthplace on the Character Generation screen. The "Show on Map" button will launch you to the map viewer so you can see the location or full details. You may even want to use the map to choose a more specific birthplace. The map features a handy search capability to let you search by name, or tag (e.g. fortification type, kingdom etc.)

<sub>Note: The map below is pixelated in this screenshot, but the original/in-app is formed from high resolution auto-stitched 5000 series atlas maps.<sub>

Once you've finished with the Character Generation screen your new character will be displayed on the Character Sheet. From here you can edit and equip your character, save and browse from your existing catalog of characters.

In addition to creating character you can build your own custom maps. Each map consists of layers configured to appear at different levels of magnification as you zoom in/out on the map. Everything from continent all the way down to a castle layout.
