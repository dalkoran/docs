# FanLore
by Nigel Spencer 2024

## Getting Started
This page will be updated soon with a guide on how to get started with using the FanLore application. Guides will include:
* Generating characters using random assignments, manual entry or the Character Point (CP) system
* Generating multi-layer zoomable maps using official maps that you own, or your own custom maps

and much more...

## Installing Ghostscript
### Why do I need to install Ghostscript?
You don't :-). It's entirely optional. 

By installing Ghostscript the application will be able to generate raster images (PNGs) from PDF content that you may 
own or have created yourself. This can be very useful if you want to use PDF maps to create zoomable maps for use
in FanLore. 

You don't need to install Ghostscript in order to extract cover art images from your PDF content, only for producing 
high resolution images of PDF pages.

The most common use case would be to generate an image from a Hârn atlas map that you have purchased.
You could do this yourself, but using Ghostscript in FanLore will make this process much easier.

### How do I install Ghostscript?
You can learn more about Ghostscript and download and install it from [their website](https://www.ghostscript.com). 

### Can I uninstall Ghostscript later?
Yes you can install and uninstall Ghostscript easily, completely independently from FanLore.
